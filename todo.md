- fix editor gimbal whatever sticking to the entity placement?
- pick a good default size for AABB
- why is AABB a schema? it's not a good decision.
- all components that exist now should define a schema. is that what we want?
- make sure the default mesh is the question mark.
- clean up BVH traversal because we now just iterate over entities in the map editor.
- clean up the renderer because it is awful.
